# Robotics

### Robot and Drone Collaboration and Automation

In this post I share my experience and a few applications of robots and drones for the indoor environment. I cover some of the steps required, and provide access to computer vision, and control software. Theres a few different projects presented here, but in summary we are after applications such as:

* Senior Care
* Home Assistance
* Security Systems
* Enchanted home appliances applications:
  * Drone signal routers
  * Food recognition with drones cameras

### Customizing Robotic xArm 6DOF

***

In the Emerging Technologies and Innovation group at GE, we designed a few experiences using a simple robot arm (Robotic xArm 6DOF). For instance, we added a camera and computer vision to allow the arm to reach for food items.&#x20;

The repositories used for this demostration can be found here:

* [Robot-Arm-](https://github.com/srinithish/Robotic-Hand-)
* [Comuter-vision-arm](https://github.com/srinithish/Smarttable)

In addition, we did a proof of concept with the robot arm collaborating with a drone, Parrot Mambo, to deliver small food items to a nearby user. Below is a demo:

### Home Assistant Robot

***

Finally, we worked closely with the [FirstBuild Microfactory](https://firstbuild.com/), to design a robot from scratch including selecting the motors, mounting and wiring batteries, and designing CAD frame with 80/20 t-slot materials that allow the user to attach different mechanisms for various applications. Additionally, a skid steer design allows for 360 turning inside the house in tight spaces and high payload capacity allows the robot to carry heavy weights without stalling torque. We add computer vision and load the drone to allow for collaboration

### UFACTORY xArm 7

***

Following the success of this project, the group invested in more sophisticated robot arms, and I participated in creating experiences including, removing dishes from a dishwasher, making soup and pizza, and loading a laundry machine with clothes. Below we have a video of our dishwasher example
